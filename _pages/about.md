Hi! 

My name is Conor Warren. I am an engineering student interested in leveraging technology to improve human health.

I currently study electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University, where I am also a research assistant in an artificial intelligence lab. My research examines novel techniques to improve the interpretability and efficiency of machine learning architectures, especially for healthcare applications. 

This website is home to a catalogue of personal and professional projects I've worked on, as well as a blog discussing topics spanning healthcare, machine learning, and entrepreneurship.

Thank you for stopping by!
